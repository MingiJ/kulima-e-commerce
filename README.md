# e-commerce application for small scale farmers

Small Scale Farming has become a revolution world wide as people have seen the profit that
comes from producing agricultural products. Previously only people with large pieces of land
would grow and rear livestock for commercial purposes. Now, we are seeing more and more
farmers get into the market even with farms as little as a half an acre. Small scale farming has
revolutionised the farming industry. The advent of small scale farming could not come at a better
time, our current society values online shopping or e-commerce as opposed to going to the
market physically. This has further been perpetuated by the current Covid-19 pandemic that has
forced us to practice social distancing. Thus selling farm produce has become a popular business
venture. The only problem now is that it is decentralised there is no central hub where all farmers
can meet the consumers on the same platform.
